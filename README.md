☀️ Solar Flow – Intelligent Solar Surplus Management System

Intelligent solar energy management system based on Shelly EM (single and three-phase), with automatic load control via Shelly 1PM and integration with electric vehicle chargers.

The system communicates via the official Shelly REST API, but also supports simulated devices that completely mimic Shelly behavior, allowing for hardware-free development and testing.
#
🧠 Main concept

The system was designed as a network of abstract energy devices, where:

* 🔌 Real Shelly devices can be added
* 🧪 Simulated devices can be created
* 🔁 Both operate identically through a common API

👉 For the system, there is no difference between real and simulated devices

#
⚙️ Supported device types

🔋 Real Shelly devices

* Shelly EM (single-phase and three-phase)
* Shelly 1PM
* Shelly Plug / compatible relays
* EV chargers integrated via Shelly
* Simulated devices
  
#
🔁 Conceptual result

[SHELLY REAL] == [SIMULATOR]

#
🔌 Device integration


The system supports:


* Adding real Shelly devices
* Creating simulated devices
* Dynamic API endpoint configuration
* Fully uniform behavior between real and simulated devices

👉 The system treats all devices as equal, regardless of their origin

#
🧪 Simulator mode

Allows you to create a complete energy setup without any hardware:

* ☀️ Real-time simulated solar production
* 🏠 Dynamic household consumption
* 🔌 Virtual devices
* ⚙️ Full energy automation testing

#
🐳 Docker execution

The system is designed to run entirely inside a Docker environment, ensuring:

* 📦 Full portability across Linux, Windows, and macOS
* 🔁 Consistent environment between development and production
* 🧪 Complete dependency isolation
* 🚀 Fast and predictable deployment
* 🔧 Reproducible execution on any machine
* 👉 Solar Flow always runs the same way, regardless of the operating system or local configuration.

👉 Represents the final output ready for production



🐧 linux_startbuild.sh

Full management script for Linux:

* build the image
* start/stop the container
* remove the system

🍎 mac_startbuild.sh

Full management script for MacOS:

* build the image
* start/stop the container
* remove the system

🪟 win_startbuild.sh

Full management script for Windows:

* build the image

#
▶️ Initial Setup (Linux)

For Linux, open a terminal and run:
```
linux_startbuild.sh build
linux_startbuild.sh start
```
#
🌐 Access the Application

After starting the system, open your browser and navigate to:
